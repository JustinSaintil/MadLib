This program (Mad Lib Generator) is designed to generate sentences using random nouns, verbs, conjunctions, adjectives, and other grammatical anomalies using predefined variables and grouping them in a logical sentence structure.

1) Create .py program involving wx.python. We will make an interactive panel in which the sentences will appear and the user can set preferences for variables in creating sentences.

2) Work with git.
MadLib.py program. Collaborate using laura and JustinWork branches, and then merge to master branch.
