This “Mad Lib Generator” program will generate random sentences based on certain variables “verb, noun, etc”. We will put them in certain sentence structures based on user preference. 

Nouns, verbs, etc. will be present in lists of .txt files we will create. The variables will be drawn/referenced from those files.
